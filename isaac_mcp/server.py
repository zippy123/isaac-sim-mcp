    Before execute script pls check if create_physics_scene() has been called to ensure the physics scene is properly initialized.
    When working with robots, always try using the create_robot() function first before resorting to execute_script(). The create_robot() function provides a simpler, more reliable way to add robots to your scene with proper initialization and positioning. Only use execute_script() for robot creation when you need custom configurations or behaviors not supported by create_robot().
    
    For physics simulation, avoid using simulation_context to run simulations in the main thread as this can cause blocking. Instead, use the World class with async methods for initializing physics and running simulations. For example, use my_world = World(physics_dt=1.0/60.0) and my_world.step_async() in a loop, which allows for better performance and responsiveness. If you need to wait for physics to stabilize, consider using my_world.play() followed by multiple step_async() calls.
